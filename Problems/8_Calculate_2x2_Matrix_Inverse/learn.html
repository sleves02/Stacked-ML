<h2>Calculating the Inverse of a 2x2 Matrix</h2>

The inverse of a matrix \(A\) is another matrix, often denoted \(A^{-1}\), such that:
\[
AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I
\]
where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a 2x2 matrix:
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
a & b \\ 
c & d 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

The inverse is:
\[
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \begin{pmatrix} 
d & -b \\ 
-c & a 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

provided that the determinant \(\det(A) = ad - bc\) is non-zero. If \(\det(A) = 0\), the matrix does not have an inverse.

This process is critical in many applications including solving systems of linear equations, where the inverse is used to find solutions efficiently.
