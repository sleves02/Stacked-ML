<h2>Calculate Eigenvalues</h2>

Eigenvalues of a matrix offer significant insight into the matrix's behavior, particularly in the context of linear transformations and systems of linear equations.

<h3> Definition </h3>
For a square matrix \(A\), eigenvalues are scalars \(\lambda\) that satisfy the equation for some non-zero vector \(v\) (eigenvector):
\[
Av = \lambda v
\]

<h3> Calculation for a 2x2 Matrix </h3>
The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix \(A\), given by:
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
a & b \\ 
c & d 
\end{pmatrix}
\]
are determined by solving the characteristic equation:
\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = 0
\]
This simplifies to a quadratic equation:
\[
\lambda^2 - \text{tr}(A) \lambda + \det(A) = 0
\]
Here, the trace of A, denoted as tr(A), is \(a + d\), and the determinant of A, denoted as det(A), is \(ad - bc\). Solving this equation yields the eigenvalues, \(\lambda\).

<h3> Significance </h3>
Understanding eigenvalues is essential for analyzing the effects of linear transformations represented by the matrix. They are crucial in various applications, including stability analysis, vibration analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in machine learning.
