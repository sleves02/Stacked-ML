<h2>Solving Linear Equations Using the Jacobi Method</h2>

The Jacobi method is an iterative algorithm used for solving a system of linear equations \(Ax = b\). This method is particularly useful for large systems where direct methods like Gaussian elimination are computationally expensive.

<h3>Algorithm Overview</h3>

For a system of equations represented by \(Ax = b\), where \(A\) is a matrix and \(x\) and \(b\) are vectors, the Jacobi method involves the following steps:
<ol>
<li><b>Initialization</b>: Start with an initial guess for \(x\).</li>
<li><b>Iteration</b>: For each equation \(i\), update \(x[i]\) using:
   \[
   x[i] = \frac{1}{a_{ii}} \left(b[i] - \sum_{j \neq i} a_{ij} x[j]\right)
   \]
   where \(a_{ii}\) are the diagonal elements of \(A\), and \(a_{ij}\) are the off-diagonal elements.</li>
<li><b>Convergence</b>: Repeat the iteration until the changes in \(x\) are below a certain tolerance or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.</li>
</ol>
This method assumes that all diagonal elements of \(A\) are non-zero and that the matrix is diagonally dominant or properly conditioned for convergence.

<h3>Practical Considerations</h3>

- The method may not converge for all matrices. <br>
- Choosing a good initial guess can improve convergence. <br>
- Diagonal dominance of \(A\) ensures convergence of the Jacobi method.
