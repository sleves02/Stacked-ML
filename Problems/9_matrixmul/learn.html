<h2>Matrix Multiplication</h2>

Consider two matrices \(A\) and \(B\), to demonstrate their multiplication, defined as follows:

- Matrix \(A\):
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
a_{11} & a_{12} \\ 
a_{21} & a_{22} 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

- Matrix \(B\):
\[
B = \begin{pmatrix} 
b_{11} & b_{12} \\ 
b_{21} & b_{22} 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

The multiplication of matrix \(A\) by matrix \(B\) is calculated as:
\[
A \times B = \begin{pmatrix} 
a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21} & a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22} \\ 
a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21} & a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22} 
\end{pmatrix}
\]

This operation results in a new matrix where each element is the result of the dot product between the rows of matrix \(A\) and the columns of matrix \(B\).
