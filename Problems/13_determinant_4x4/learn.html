<h2>Determinant of a 4x4 Matrix using Laplace's Expansion</h2>

<p>Laplace's Expansion, also known as cofactor expansion, is a method to calculate the determinant of a square matrix of any size. For a 4x4 matrix \(A\), this method involves expanding \(A\) into minors and cofactors along a chosen row or column.</p>

<p>Consider a 4x4 matrix \(A\):</p>

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{34} \\
a_{41} & a_{42} & a_{43} & a_{44}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

<p>The determinant of \(A\), \(\det(A)\), can be calculated by selecting any row or column (e.g., the first row) and using the formula that involves the elements of that row (or column), their corresponding cofactors, and the determinants of the 3x3 minor matrices obtained by removing the row and column of each element. This process is recursive, as calculating the determinants of the 3x3 matrices involves further expansions.</p>

<p>The expansion formula for the first row is as follows:</p>

\[
\det(A) = a_{11}C_{11} - a_{12}C_{12} + a_{13}C_{13} - a_{14}C_{14}
\]

<p>Here, \(C_{ij}\) represents the cofactor of element \(a_{ij}\), which is calculated as \((-1)^{i+j}\) times the determinant of the minor matrix obtained after removing the \(i\)th row and \(j\)th column from \(A\).</p>

<p>Laplace's Expansion is a powerful method for calculating determinants, especially for small matrices, and it provides a clear insight into the recursive nature of matrix determinants.</p>
